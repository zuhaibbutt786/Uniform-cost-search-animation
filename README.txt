# Interactive Uniform-Cost Search (UCS) Visualization

## Description

This project provides an interactive web-based visualization of the **Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)** algorithm. Users can:

- Dynamically create and customize a graph by adding nodes and edges with associated costs.
- Visualize the **priority queue** as the algorithm processes nodes.
- Watch a step-by-step animation of the UCS traversal in action.

The interface is intuitive, featuring a dynamic canvas for graph rendering, interactive forms for graph input, and a live priority queue display.

## Features

- **Dynamic Graph Creation**:  
  Users can input nodes, edges, and costs to build their custom graphs.

- **Step-by-Step UCS Visualization**:  
  Observe the algorithm as it explores nodes based on cumulative cost, ensuring optimal pathfinding.

- **Interactive Priority Queue**:  
  A live view of the priority queue updates dynamically during the algorithm's execution.

- **Reset and Replay Options**:  
  Reset the graph and start new simulations at any time.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling and visual design.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For dynamic functionality, including graph rendering and UCS logic.
- **Canvas API**: For drawing the graph dynamically in the browser.
- **FontAwesome**: For attractive social media icons.
