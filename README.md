# Uniform-cost-search-animation
This project provides an interactive web-based visualization of the Uniform-Cost Search (UCS) algorithm. Users can:  Dynamically create and customize a graph by adding nodes and edges with associated costs. Visualize the priority queue as the algorithm processes nodes. Watch a step-by-step animation of the UCS traversal in action.
