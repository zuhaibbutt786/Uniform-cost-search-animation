Interactive Uniform-Cost Search (UCS) Visualization
Description
This project provides an interactive web-based visualization of the Uniform-Cost Search (UCS) algorithm. Users can:

Dynamically create and customize a graph by adding nodes and edges with associated costs.
Visualize the priority queue as the algorithm processes nodes.
Watch a step-by-step animation of the UCS traversal in action.
The interface is simple and intuitive, featuring a dynamic canvas for graph rendering, interactive forms for graph input, and a live priority queue display.

Features
Dynamic Graph Creation:
Users can input nodes, edges, and costs to build their custom graphs.

Step-by-Step UCS Visualization:
Observe the algorithm as it explores nodes based on cumulative cost, ensuring optimal pathfinding.

Interactive Priority Queue:
A live view of the priority queue updates dynamically during the algorithm's execution.

Reset and Replay Options:
Reset the graph and start new simulations at any time.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the content.
CSS3: For styling and visual design.
JavaScript (ES6): For dynamic functionality, including graph rendering and UCS logic.
Canvas API: For drawing the graph dynamically on the browser.
FontAwesome: For attractive social media icons.
How to Use
Clone or download the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/interactive-ucs-visualization.git
Open the index.html file in your browser.
Use the Graph Editor to add edges:
Specify the "From Node," "To Node," and "Cost."
Click Add Edge to update the graph dynamically.
Click Start UCS:
Enter the start and goal nodes when prompted.
Watch the step-by-step traversal animation.
Observe the live updates in the Priority Queue.
Use the Reset button to clear the graph and start over.
